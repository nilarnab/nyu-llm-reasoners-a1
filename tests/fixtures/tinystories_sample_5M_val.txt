One day, Sam and Mia find a new block. It is big and blue and shiny. They want to use it for their play. They take turns holding it and looking at it. They wonder what they can make with it.
Sam has an idea. He says, "Let's make a big tower with the blue block on top. It will be the best tower ever!" Mia agrees. They start to stack their blocks on the floor. They make a tall and strong tower. They are almost done.
Sam reaches for the blue block. He wants to put it on the top of the tower. He lifts it up high. But the blue block is heavy and slippery. Sam loses his grip. He drops the blue block.
The blue block falls down. It hits the tower. The tower breaks. The blocks scatter everywhere. Sam and Mia are sad. They look at their broken tower and their blue block.
They start to cry. They say, "Oh no! Our tower is gone! Our blue block is bad!"
But then, they hear a voice. It is their mom. She comes into the room. She sees the mess and the tears. She says, "What happened, my loves?"
Sam and Mia tell her what happened. They say, "We wanted to play with the blue block. But we dropped it. And it broke our tower. And we are sad."
Mom hugs them. She says, "I'm sorry, my loves. I know you worked hard on your tower. But it's okay. You can build another one. And the blue block is not bad. It was an accident. Accidents happen sometimes. You can still play with it. Maybe you can use it for something else. Or you can share it with a friend. Or you can give it to me. I like blue things."
Sam and Mia stop crying. They look at their mom and their blue block. They feel better. They say, "Thank you, mom. We love you. And we love our blue block. Can we play with it again?"
Mom smiles. She says, "Of course, my loves. You can play with it again. And I will help you clean up the mess. And then we can have a snack. How does that sound?"
Sam and Mia nod. They say, "That sounds good, mom. We are hungry. And we want to play more."
They hug their mom and their blue block. They are happy again. They are ready to play.

Her teacher smiled and said, "That sounds wonderful, Anna. But remember, you have to share the stage with your classmates. Everyone has something unique to offer."
Anna nodded, but she did not listen. She thought she was the best performer in the class. She did not care about what the others would do. She wanted to shine by herself.
The day of the show came. Anna wore her favorite dress and put on a big bow. She waited for her turn. She saw her classmates perform different things. Some read poems, some played instruments, some did magic tricks. They all looked happy and confident. The audience clapped and cheered for them.
Then it was Anna's turn. She ran to the stage and grabbed the microphone. She started to sing and dance. She sang very loud and fast. She danced very wild and hard. She did not look at the audience. She only looked at herself. She thought she was amazing.
But the audience did not think so. They did not clap or cheer. They looked confused and bored. Some covered their ears. Some whispered to each other. Some left their seats. Anna did not notice. She kept singing and dancing.

One day, a boy named Max came to the park. He had a shiny new ball and a fancy bike. He said he was wealthy and his dad bought him everything he wanted. He said he was better at basketball than Lily and Sam. He said he could catch the ball in the hoop every time.
Lily and Sam did not like Max. He was mean and rude. They did not want to play with him. But Max said he wanted to play with them. He said he would let them use his ball if they could catch it in the hoop. He said he would give them his bike if they could catch it ten times in a row.
Lily and Sam thought Max was lying. They did not want his ball or his bike. They liked their own ball and their own bikes. They said they did not want to play with him. They said they wanted to play with each other.
Max got angry. He said they were silly and poor. He said he would take their ball and their bikes. He grabbed their ball and threw it at them. He tried to catch it in the hoop, but he missed. The ball bounced away and rolled down the hill.
Lily and Sam ran after the ball. They caught it and hugged it. They were happy. They did not care about Max or his ball or his bike. They had each other and their ball and their bikes. They were wealthy in their own way.

"Why did you do that, Ben?" Mom asked.
"Because I found a toy and she wanted it," Ben said.
Mom shook her head. She was not happy.
"Ben, that is not a toy. That is coal. Coal is dirty and can hurt you. And you should not pinch Lily. Pinching is not nice. Pinching is mean. You have to say sorry to Lily and give her the coal," Mom said.

Lily took the coal and said thank you. She was not angry and sad anymore. She was happy.

Lila was an adventurous girl who loved to explore. She liked to climb trees, dig in the sand, and chase butterflies. One day, she saw a big balloon floating in the sky. It was red and shiny and had a basket underneath. Lila wondered what it would be like to ride in the balloon and see the world from above.
She ran after the balloon, hoping to catch it. She followed it across the field, over the hill, and into the forest. She did not notice that she was far away from her home and her family. She only had eyes for the balloon.
"Hello, little girl," a voice said from the basket. "Do you want to join me in my balloon?"
Lila looked up and saw a friendly man with a long beard and a hat. He smiled and waved at her.
"Who are you?" Lila asked.
"I am a traveler," the man said. "I go wherever the wind takes me. I see many things and meet many people. It is a wonderful life."
Lila was curious and excited. She wanted to see many things and meet many people too. She wanted to be a traveler.
"Can I come with you?" she asked.
The man nodded. "Of course, you can. But you have to ask your parents first. Do they know where you are?"
Lila suddenly remembered her parents. She had left them without saying goodbye. She felt a pang of guilt and fear. She did not know how to find her way back.
"I don't know," she said. "I was following the balloon. I wanted to see the sky."
The man frowned. "That was not very wise, little girl. The sky is beautiful, but it does not belong to you. You belong to your parents. They must be very worried about you. You should go back to them."
Lila nodded. She realized that the man was right. She loved the balloon, but she loved her parents more. She wanted to be with them.
"Can you help me go back?" she asked.
The man smiled. "Of course, I can. I have a map and a compass. I can take you to the nearest town and find someone who can take you home. Come on, hop in the basket. It will be a short ride."
Lila thanked the man and climbed into the basket. She felt a rush of air as the balloon lifted off the ground. She looked down and saw the forest, the hill, and the field. She looked up and saw the sky. It was blue and bright and full of clouds. She felt happy and grateful. She had seen the sky, but she had also learned a lesson. She had been adventurous, but she had also been careless. She decided to be more careful and respectful in the future. She decided to always tell her parents where she was going and when she was coming back. She decided to enjoy the sky, but not to forget where she belonged.
